# ml-emotional-tone-classifier
This repository contains an AI model that classifies short text (3–25 words) into seven tones: joy, sadness, anger, love, fear, surprise, and neutral. The neural network uses an input layer the size of the input text's word count, three hidden layers having 16 neurons each and a 7-neuron output layer.
